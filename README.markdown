## Lend A Hand

If you're interested in helping out, fork the project and start coding! I'd love to have you on board. You can always shoot me an email at lonnieje@gmail.com and we can talk about how you'll best fit it and what the best place to start coding would be.

*NOTE: Latest database dump can be found under bonfire/application/db/backups. Import that into a new database, and setup your database connections and you should be good to go. You can login to the admin /admin with email: admin@bonfire.com, pass: bonfire.*

Let's make this the best kick-start to any CodeIgniter project.
